# An Analysis of Election Votes

## Project Overview
Performed data analysis on election data for three counties in the State of Colorado.  The analysis calculated the total number of votes cast, compiled a list of candidates who received votes, calculated the total number of votes each candidate received, calculated the percentage of votes each candidate won, and determined the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.10, Visual Studio 1.66.2

## Challenge Summary
This python script was created with the intention of analyzing election data for the State of Colorado.  It summarizes the election results by delivering the total number of votes cast, percentage and total outcomes by county, percentage and total outcomes by candidate, county with the largest number of votes, and the winner of the election.  The election commission can use this script for elections in other counties as well.  The format of the new dataset would have to be the same as 'election_results.csv' and the file path in the script would have to be updated to the correct file location.  This script can also be used to perform election analysis for multiple States.  The variables and print statements in the script would have to be changed from 'county' to 'state'.  For example, 'county_list' and 'county_votes' would change to 'state_list' and 'state_votes' and 'County Votes' and 'Largest County Turnout' would change to 'State Votes' and 'Largest State Turnout'.
